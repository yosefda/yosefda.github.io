**perpetual motion**    
*noun*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a state in which movement or action is or appears to be continuous and unceasing.

Like a perpetual motion, life should be a continuous improvement whether it be personal or professional.
This blog is all about that, collection of notes from my own perpetual-motion journey (mostly professional/technical stuffs :)).
